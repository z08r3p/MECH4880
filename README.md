MECH4880 REFRIGERATION AND AIR CONDITIONING 
ASSIGNMENT 1 (2024) – Assignment Helper (Ver 2) 
Aim 
The   purpose   of this   document   is   to   provide   a   more   detailed   explanation   of the   minimum   project   requirements in a partially stepped-out manner.
This document outlines two main types of   questions to follow:
• Discuss questions      are      designed      to      give      you      some      direction      for      what      to      do      next      while   developing    your    understanding    of    the    concept.      Discuss      questions      should      typically      be   answered in a   maximum of   one   paragraph,   while   the depth of   your   understanding   and   research   should be   demonstrated in your response, keeping your answer succinct is also a critical part   of   explaining and reporting engineering findings.
• Perform questions,   which   usually   follow   from   discuss   questions,   are   designed   to   use   the   understanding you develop from the discuss question and complete that section of   the   report.Preceding the breakdown   of   both parts   of   the   assignment   is   a   list   of assumptions already made   for   your assignment; take care in reading and understanding them, as they   can   greatly   simplify the work   you need to complete.

Part B – System Design and Sustainability 
Section 1 – Zoning and Simulation Analysis 
(1) - Produce conditioned/ventilated space maps and discuss on thermal zone plans 
Discuss: Define and compare conditioned   and ventilated   spaces;   give   two   examples   of spaces/room   types for   each.Perform.: Using two different colours,   preferably   blue for conditioned and red for   ventilated,   produce   an   overlay   of   the building   floor plans   showing   all   conditioned   and ventilated   spaces.   Are   there   any   spaces on the building plan which are neither conditioned nor ventilated?
Discuss: What   is   thermal   zoning,   and   what   information   does   it   provide   when   setting   up   heat   load   calculations?
(2) Design Brief for the whole building Discuss: Briefly   discuss the   following   features   of   the   building:   where   are the   partitions   (those   that   will   add   to   the   heat   load),   which   rooms   will   have   roof loads,   how   many   skylights   are   there,   and   which   spaces do they interact with. Also   briefly   discuss   how   the   functionality   of   the   room   (i.e.,   use of   room, occupation group, equipment etc.) affect the room heat load.
Perform. Using   the   conclusion   from the   discussion, prepare   a   design brief for   the   whole   shopping   centre,    identify    the      key      considerations/factors      that      contributes      to      heat      load      estimation      when   designing the HVAC   system and, propose and   justify one   possible   thermal   zone   in   the   building   (not   including the gym)
Perform.: Propose    in      your    design      brief   2-4    suggestions    to   reduce    the      required    cooling   capacity of   the building without compromising the building performance.

代做程序编程语言haust   systems that can be installed to serve   all ventilated   spaces.
Discuss: Does   the   lift   shaft   require   mechanical   ventilation?   What   are   some   of the   factors   that   may   lead   to   heat   gain   within   a   lift   shaft? Hint: You   may   consult   NCC   2022   Specification   E3D2.
Perform: Using   the   appropriate   appendices   from   AS   1668.2 – 2012, calculate   and   report   the exhaust   rate   (L/s) for   each   ventilated   space   within   the   building.
Section 2 – Schematics and Duct Design 
(4) - Air schematics 
Discuss: What is the purpose of   an air schematic? What information   can   it provide?Produce: Construct   a   separate   or   combined   full   air   schematics   for the   supply   and ventilation   of   the   building.   All   equipment   serving   these   rooms   must be   represented   on   the   schematic,   complete   with   all the   spaces   they   serve.   The   schematic   should   show, at   a   minimum,   the   airflow   into   the   Gym and   the   flow rates for all relevant exhaust fans (Ventilated   Space   ONLY).
(5) - Duct Design 
Discuss: Why are different maximum airspeeds used for main ducts   and branch   ducts?
Discuss: What are the pros/cons of   reducing   duct   size   for the   same   airflow?   What   are   the   pros/cons   of   increasing duct size for the   same   airflow?
Perform.: Construct   a   single-line   duct   layout   and preliminary   duct   sizes   for   supply,   outside   air   and   exhaust systems, indicating duct size and   flow rate   for the   Gym.   Perform   the   same   for the exhaust ducts for the building's ventilated spaces.
Section 3 – Duct Analysis, System Selection and Sustainability 
(6) - Pressure loss calculations and fan selection (Ventilated spaces only) 
Discuss: In terms of   duct pressure loss calculations, what is an   index   run   (equal   friction   method)?Discuss: Why   is   the   index   run   pressure   drop   used      as   the   pressure   drop      for   the      entire      system?   How   can   we   achieve   this   pressure   drop   at   each   outlet   to   ensure   the   correct   airflow   (equal   friction   method)?
Perform. Indicate the index run on the previously drawn supply   system   and   all   exhaust   duct   systems.
Discuss: Pressure   losses   are   due   to   two   main   causes, straight   duct   and   duct   fittings,   provide   the formula   for both and explain   each term.Perform.: For   ventilated   spaces   only,   calculate   and   report   the   pressure   loss   (equal   friction   method)   along   the   index   run. Only   the   losses for   the   rigid duct should   be counted,i.e. ignore any   pressure losses   associated with intakes, grilles, flexible connections, etc. Add    100   Pa   pressure   drop   onto   your   final value to compensate for this assumption.Discuss: Briefly discuss three important factors/considerations in duct design   and   how   these   could   be/have been implemented in the duct layout produced for the previous section. Perform.: Select   and   report   fan   requirements   for   each   pressure   loss   calculation   and   justify   their   selection based on the previous discussion question. (Hint: you only need to provide at least pressure   drop   and   flow   rate.) Discuss: Discuss three important factors when selecting a   fan.(7) - AHU selection Discuss: What are the three of   the most important parameters (do not discuss   cost) to   consider when   selecting an AHU? Produce: Select   appropriate AHUs   for the   Gym.   The unit   selected   should, as   a minimum, meet the   capacity   and   airflow   required. The   unit   can   be   assumed   to   be   air-cooled or   connected   to   a   chiller system   based   on   your   AHU   selection   (Note: you   do   not   need   to   design   or   select   any   associated   equipment). Discuss: What is the economy cycle? What is   different   about   AHUs   or   the   surrounding   system   with   economy cycles? (8) - Building improvements and sustainable design Discuss: What building   features have the most   significant   heat   load,   and   what   improvements   could   you   make   to   mitigate   their   impact? (1 paragraph   per   feature, minimum   3   features) Discuss: Would reducing the   air off   temperature   (reducing the   coil   temperature)   reduce   the   cooling   capacity required? Why/why not? Discuss: Based on the preliminary CFD analysis provided, discuss your understanding of   the current   design, with   focus   on the   flow behaviour and thermal   comfort. What   improvements   can   be   made   in   actual design and installation by implementing the insight from CFD results? Identify possible design   flaws in the current system   and   their   impact. Discuss: Briefly describe two rating schemes that have been implemented in the building industry in   order to   encourage   sustainability. Discuss their impact   on   HVAC   system   design   and   to   what   extent   you think they have been successful. (2 paragraphs maximum)Assumptions:
1.       All kitchen   exhausts   are   considered   out   of   scope
2.       FCU’s and   AHU’s   can be   assumed   to   have   the   same   function   and   features   and   so   only   AHU’s   need   to be used
3.       All      duct      is      designed      to      be      rectangular/square      and      in      increments      of      no      less      than      50mm      (e.g.   325x350mm   is   not   allowed, but   450x600mm   is), and   flexible   duct   is   not   required   to   be   sized.
4.         Duct design does not require economy cycle.
5.       “DA09   infiltration”:   infiltration   through   walls   and   windows   only   needs   to   be   applied   for   the   gym   considered in the hand calculations.6.       For   Part   A   only, all   glass   (internal   and   external) can   be   treated   as   6mm   plate   type, as   defined   by   DA09.
7.       For   the   purpose   of hand   calculations,   please   assume   the   false   ceiling   space   to   be   void   (you   should   still   justify why this is appropriate).
8.         Several   spaces   require   pressure   differentials,   and   these   are   all   out   of   scope.   Simply   achieve   the required   airflow   as per the heat   loads that you   calculate.   Air   change requirements,   however,   should   be   met.
9.       For   internal   loads,   all   equipment   listed   should   be   referenced   from   the   quoted   ASHRAE   document   first, followed   by   DA09 and   any   external   source.
10.   Grille   selection   is   outside   of   scope.
11.   All   AHUs   are   to be   served by   chilled water   systems,   and   all   water   systems   within   the building   are   out of   scope.
12.   Façade   shading: the   structures   are   solar   fins   and   are   similar   in   nature   to   those   shown   below   in   the   two images   [1]   [2].

13.   On   making   your   own   assumptions:   As   a   general   rule   of   thumb, if   it   is   not   in   the   assignment   documents,   just   make   the   assumption   that   will   make   your   calculations   the   easiest   possible   while    still   being      justifiable.   Extending   from   this,   the   assignment   helper   can   be   used   as   a   tool   to   identify the key elements      that we are looking for; while you will have to perform. some tasks out of   the listing, try to maximise      your use of   time by not overdoing or over-detailing these   sections.
